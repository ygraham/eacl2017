The president of the second penal section of the Rome tribunal, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the petition made by the estate agent, Danilo Coppola that had requested to be able to move from his home town, Grottaferrata, to an abode in Rome.
Coppola is under investigation for bankruptcy within the scope of the inquiry on the counter-proposal regarding the Unipol-Bnl takeover.
While on trial, last week, he obtained the release from house arrest transformed into an obligation to remain resident in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the estate agent could travel from the country town within the province to an abode within the capital.
According to the tribunal, however, these trips   (  against which the PM has advised  )  would allow him to influence his company and to have access to the evidence that is used to charge him.
The astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates of the Interntional Space Station   (  ISS  )   spent more than seven hours working in space, repairing a mangled solar array, indispensable to continue the scientific activities of the station.
A dangerous spacewalk which set a record in its lenght, its distance from habitable module, its rapidity and in the «repairing» tools used by the astronauts.
The problem came out on Tuesday, when the astronauts pulled the Harmony module from the Discovery space shuttle, a big cylindrical piece charged of holding both European and Japanese scientific laboratories   (  see figure  )  .
This module is a sort of deck landing for the modules-laboratories.
But it is necessary to provide them with elecrticity.
In order to produce electricity, then, the second task of the crew was to move a 17,5 tons module for solar arrays, which was already in the ISS.
After having moved the module, the crew started using its solar arrays, which have a wingspan of 76 meters.
It was there that a solar array, bending like an accordion, was mangled by a rope.
In order to avoid further damages, the array was stopped from bending.
The astronauts, whose spacewalk's aim was to check the Discovery shuttle and repair another solar array with a faulty rotation system, had to repair the damaged one too.
And Scott Parazynski was choosen for the stitching, on the end of the 58-foot robot arm that was added up for the rapair.
He is one of the best NASA spacewalker.
He's tall, strong, very capable, he has a great chest and long arms.
At the age of 46, with a past medical carriere, he was charged of « operate » on that « wounded » solar array.
After having examined the damages, he dissected the wrong rope and fixed a sort of « splint » on the mangled area.
He has been helped by another spacewalker who stayed next to him, while his crew and its leader Peggy Whitson was helping him from the inside.
The tool he used, a tiny hockey stick wrapped in insulator in order to avoid electrocution on the solar arrays producing hundreds of volts, was planned and created in the space station.
At the end of the operation, before checking his tools and coming back to the station, Scott Parazynski waited for the solar array to be completely unfolded.
Yesterday, in the afternoon, the astronautes had a half day of rest, while seven astronautes are today ready to leave on the Discovery shuttle, coming back to Earth on Wednesday.
The social works referred to in the programs such as Habitat, Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants risk not to be completed or to have serious delays due to the lack of funds, said Miguel Angel Lopez Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that although so far the work programs have advanced they are at risk because the State Government failed to make the contributions that correspond, which represent a resource superior to 11 million pesos in all three programs.
He noted that the total investment in these three programs is of nearly 50 million pesos, of which the State has to contribute with 25 percent and so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, so the possible delay in the completion of these is in force.
"They have to contribute with almost 12 million and even though the year is ending they have not given us a dime, since starting with July they had to give us a part," he said, "in order not to delay we have started the works and they are very advanced, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State did not comply with the contributions it had to make, so that at the beginning of the administration the municipality had to borrow money in order to cover more than 7 million, a sum that was not provided on that occasion by the state administration.
"It happened to us in the previous administration because the State did not have the financial capacity to participate and the programs continued advancing, and this year in order to access these programs we had to get the resources to cover what the state left pending," he explained.
Although there is a commitment of the state authorities to comply with the delivery of these resources, he said that the request was made ​​to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to speed up the efforts so that the percentages that correspond to them to come as quickly as possible.
"They have to contribute with almost 12 million and even though the year is ending they have not given us a dime."
Alexandre Guerini, 53, director of waste processing companies and brother of the president of General Council of Bouches-du-Rhone, was arrested and sent to Luynes prison near Aix-en-Provence in the context of an investigation of public contracts presumed fraudulent.
According to his attorney, Alexandre Guerini is accused of the abusive use of company property, the theft public funds, of receiving stolen goods, of active corruption and of the sale of influence.
"Alexande Guereini is combative and is willing to answer any questions which the magistrate may ask, but not fantasies."

M. Guerini, brother of the strong man of the socialist party in the département, Jean-Noel Guerini, passed to his judge prior to his hearing through his attorney an explanatory memorandum.

Michel Karabadjakian, assistant director-general of the cleansingof Marseille Province Metropole   (  MPM  )   is being prosecuted for "sale of influence and passive corruption."
Two functionaries of the Aubagne conurbation. Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were arrested and quationed one concerning the "theft of public property by a person responsible for public service" and the other concerning "complicity in the theft of public funds."
Lastly, the companion of Alexandre Guerini, Jeanne Peretti was questioned concerning "receiving stolen company roperty."
Among persons confronted with M. Guerini is Stephane Brunengo-Girard, recetly arrested in a parallel affair concerning fraudulent public contracts involving Corsica.

According to a source close to the inquiry,the investigations concentrate in particular on the conditions of the award and functioning of a discharge of La Ciotat, which collects Aubagne waste as well as the waste from certain towns of the urban community of Marseille   (  MPM  )  .
Several hundred university students created a live chain around the nuclear power plant in Iran.
The gesture is to express their support of their country's nuclear program against a possible Israel attack.
At Tuesday noon, students' prayers in front of the building were followed by their chanting of death to both the USA and Israel.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred university students created a live chain around Isfahan Uranium Conversion Facility.
This way, they express their readiness to protect their country's nuclear program with their own lives.
In its recent report, the International Atomic Energy Agency   (  IAEA  )   stated that everything leads to the conclusion that Iran has not stopped striving for a nuclear weapon.
Possible attack on Iran nuclear facilities has been discussed in Israel.
At Tuesday noon, students' prayers in front of the entrance into Isfahan Uranium Conversion Facility were followed by their chanting of death to both the USA and Israel.
In case of an attack, aimed at the highest possible paralysation of the Iranian nuclear program, the targets would be, based on Israel press, the facilities in both Isfahan and Natanz, where the uranium is being enriched.
The English teacher tried in Sudan for offending Islam has been sentenced to 15 days' imprisonment and to expulsion by Khartoum court on Thursday night, explained her lawyer.
The English teacher has been accused of allowing her pupils aged between 6 and 7 to give the name of Muhammad to a teddy bear, when every representation of the Islam's prophet is banned.
She was liable to lashes punishment.
This 54-year-old English teacher, who was working at the Unity High School of Khartoum in Sudan, has been arrested last Sunday at her home, with the accuse both of threatenig Islam and sedition, according to the article no. 125 of the Sudanese criminal code, following many complaints of the children's parents to the Sudan's Ministry Of Education.
In fact, the case goes back to the month of September, when the school teacher asked her pupils, aged between 6 and 7, to choose a name for the class teddy bear.
«Eight names came out from the children's mouth, among those Hassan, Abdullah and Muhammad», explains the school headmaster Robert Boulos.
At the end, after the class'vote, 20 children out of 23 have choosen Muhammad as their favourite name.
Surely, Muhammad is the name of the Muslim prophet, but first of all it's a very common name in Sudan.
Then, the children created a book for the class with the bear's picture followed by the legend «My name is Muhammad».
The bear itself didn't wear any label with that name, but the problem lies in the prophet's represantation, considered as an offense to Islam.
A Muslim collegue of Gillian Gibbons, who's a teacher in the same school in Sudan, has highlighted that he knew her well and that she would have never done anything offensive for any faith, «I'm just sorry she has asked her pupils to vote for a name», according to him, it's simply an «innocent mistake».
It's an opinion shared with many of the teacher's pupils, who describe her as «very attentive towards her pupils» and «a person who never talks about religion within the class».
Moreover, it should be reminded that Muhammad is the second most common name in Great Britain, which is written in English in 14 different ways.
This name, which is often choosen by Muslim families, is one way of honouring the prophete   (  it is often given to the family's firstborn  )  .
But which rules regulate the use of that name?
For istance, is it possible to give it to a toy?
Certainly, it's a matter of interpretation.
Four hundred million euros in loans will become available for education, transportation, the environmental infrastructure and energy development in the wake of three accords signed by Finance Minister János Veres and European Investment Bank    (   EIB   )    Vice-President Marta Gajecka, in Budapest on Friday.
EIB approved a framework package of 300 million euros in 2006 to help the Hungarian budget finance transportation and environmental projects being implemented by the cohesion fund. A concrete agreement for 100 million from the package was signed earlier, so one new contract covers use of the remaining 200 million euros.
The second agreement, for 150 million euros, will help the budget finance education-related projects.
EIB has already approved a 300 million euro package for Hungary to use for upgrades to these areas. The extra 150 million euros can be used later, when the credit agreement is extended.
The third agreement was for 50 million euros to be used for innovation. The central budget plans to incorporate it primarily into a R&amp;D project at Debrecen University.
The talks included a new metro line under construction in Budapest.
They agreed that when Hungary finalizes metro financing details with the EU, they would revisit the original contracts to see whether they needed to be amended, and if so, how.
Veres said he believed that latter discussion would take place in the first quarter of 2008.
EIB has provided Hungary with the equivalent of 8.4 billion euros since 1990, which were used to finance 113 projects.
EIB is linking interest rates on the loans to the EURIBOR. It is allowing an 8 year grace period, and is charging no commission to maintain fund availability.
When you ask men to name some typical bad habits women have, they usually come up with all of them in an instant.
Dear ladies, do you recognise yourself in the lines to follow, describing several women's habits that make the men see red?
Shopping.
Does your other half complain you are addicted to shopping?
Do you need to buy at least one piece of clothing a week?
Do you like shopping, in mass sales?
If so, then your shopping may be seen as bad habit.
Some women recognise they should somewhat control their passion for shopping.
Still, who of you could resist walking through clothes shops looking for well fitting clothes and then trying them all   (  ideally, in various colour versions  )   in the changing rooms?
Shopping may be a hobby for a majority of women, but for men, it may become absolute hell.
Just remember how many times you have told your other half to wait for you outside...
Permanent Dissatisfaction.
"Am I too fat?"
"I need to lose at least five kilos - should I start doing some exercise?"
"Are you still attracted to me?"
Do you find these sentences familiar?
You do?
Then, you belong to the group of women obsessed by their appearance.
Not that you should stop looking after yourself, but many men are literary allergic to their partners" constant complaints about their looks.
The stronger sex also agrees that the higher the frequency of such complaints, the more annoying women are.
Order and Cleanliness First.
It is like a never ending story.
Cleaning the windows, vacuuming, wiping the floors, dusting, scrubbing the bathtub - at least twice a week.
Do you blame your partner for stepping onto the clean tiles in dirty shoes; your children for messing up a clean sink and leaving fingerprints over the glass pane in the living room that was so difficult to clean?
In case you suffer from this "deviation," try to realise that no extremes are good; and that within your family, order and cleanliness should not go first.
This harmless desire for cleanliness may threaten your relationships, as well as the entire family.
Bossing About.
"Throw the underwear into the bin."
"Do you plan to wear the dirty socks tomorrow?"
"Wet dishtowels do not belong on the floor."
If you boss your partner around several times a day, he may find it very annoying.
Naturally, you mean well, you just want everything to be perfect.
Maybe, if men realised that, women would not have to boss them around so much...
Gossiping.
Some women love gossiping, offending, and plotting against others.
Women are focused on relationships, which is why they like to discuss who, where, who with, how, and why.
Every now and then, probably each of us releases a gossip here or there.
Let's be frank, this is probably the nature all women.
However, there are tougher gossips, women who enjoy frequent gossiping and despise everyone. They are, especially within a female work team, very dangerous for their surroundings.
Hungarian law names the red-letter days specifically, and reorganizing working days to increase the number of days off around the holidays has become a general practice, although next year we will not see quite so much reorganization.
Holidays are not uniform in the EU or the USA either.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes among national holidays, state/bank holidays, and non-working days.
Non-working days are for the most part religious holidays and anniversaries of significant historical events.
Hungary celebrates New Year's Eve and Day: the final day of the old year and the first day of the new one are both non-working days - the latter if for no other reason, then to recover from New Year's Eve festivities.
There are a total of eleven red-letter days in each calendar year.
March 15 is a national holiday commemorating the revolution of 1848 while October 23 commemorates the revolution of 1956.
August 20 marks the founding of the nation, while May Day is Labour Day. On November 1 and 2 we commemorate the dead, remembering our friends and relatives who have left us.
In addition, Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas are each two-day holidays..
Since our state, national or even religious holidays rarely fall on the weekend, it has become customary to reorganize the working week when there is only a single workday between the holiday and the weekend.
The long weekend comes with a price however, which is to have to spend the preceding or succeeding Saturday at work or in school.
For many years, the minister of labour has issued decrees naming the days on which we have to work to get extra day off between the holiday and the weekend.
The decree covers all employers and all workers they employ, as well as civil servants and public employees.
It does not cover staff in facilities, businesses or institutions that regularly operate round-the-clock, and where staff works 24/7.
The last changes this year will be around the end-of-year holidays. As of December 24, the whole country will come to a halt, for we have learned that most people find ways to take off the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve, either by saving vacation days or by working longer hours before and after the holidays and taking comp time.
Next year most holidays will come during mid-week, so where will be less manipulation of the calendar than this year.
The first re-organization of the working week will occur to accommodate May Day and allow working people to have four consecutive days off.
Saturday, April 26 will be a workday, and in exchange, Friday, May 2 will be a day off.
The working week will be turned about again around the October 23 holiday. Saturday, October 18 will be a workday so that people may have Friday, October 24 off.
The end of the year, however, will be wall-to-wall holidays, with most people enjoying time off from December 24 through the New Year, even though New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Listening to music at high volume for a prolonged period of time using portable musical devices such as Mp3 players could cause permanent lesions to hearing.
This is what a European Commission reports, which in a communication released in Brussels cites the advice given by the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks   (  SCENIHR  )   of the EU, published today.
"From this scientific advice – the note reads – emerges that 5- 10 % of those that, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music using portable musical players weekly for more than an hour a day with the device at high volume risk a permanent loss of hearing ability".
"It worries me that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable musical players and cellular phones at very high volume may unconsciously damage their hearing in an irreparable way", declares Meglena Kuneva.
"From the scientific findings – carries on the EU spokesperson – a clear risk emerges and we have to react rapidly.
What counts most, we need to sensitize consumers and make this information available to the public.
Besides, in light of this scientific advice, we have to re-examine existent control systems to make sure that they are completely effective and kept up to date with new technology".
Brussels had asked the independent scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the widespread use of portable musical players and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise they generate.
"Scientists – concludes the EU executive – confirm that there are reasons for concern and the European Commission will now examine, together with member states and other interested parties, what measures can be taken to better protect children and young people from exposure to noise coming portable musical players and related equipment".
Currently, a European security provision already exists which limits the noise level of portable musical players to 100 dB, but concerns regarding hearing damage caused by an excessive exposure to such noise sources, are increasing.
It is possible to considerably limit the damage by resorting to solutions such as the reduction of level and duration of the noise exposure.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee points out that if users of portable musical players listen to music at high volume   (  .
People who listen to music under such conditions for longer durations risk a permanent loss of hearing ability after a 5 year period.
This is the case for 5-10% of users of such devices and their number can be quantified to between 2.5 and 10 million people within the EU.
The owner of Student Agency, Radim Jančura, will today file a slander suit against three social democrat commissioners.
These are Michal Hašek, commissioner for South Moravia, Radko Martínek, commissioner for Pardubice, and Olomouc commissioner Martin Tesařík.
Jančura announced this in the Twenty Minutes programme on Radiožurnál.
The suit relates to the company's attempts to operate regional trains in certain regions.
However, all the regions eventually signed a long-term contract with Czech Railways.
So now all three commissioners are attacking us and saying that we're getting the best out of it, while the offer we put forward was just what they themselves wanted.
They claim that we're more expensive than Czech Railways, which is not true, as we know the Czech Railways prices that were concluded last week.
So all we can do is defend ourselves.
It's for slander against Student Agency, Jančura told Radiožurnál.
He also said that he has proof from all the regional authorities that they did not act in accordance with European law.
He is therefore preparing a motion for the European Commission.
Hašek sees the suit as a further continuation of Mr Jančura's great media show, which works as a free advertisement for himself and his company.
It's understandable that I'm prepared to defend my good name and that of my region, and I call upon the other commissioners to do the same.
I expect that this matter will clearly show that it is Mr Jančura who is manipulating the public over regional rail transport and using lies and false arguments, said Hašek.
Last week, Jančura said that he is investing several million crowns in advertising to draw attention to these inappropriate actions taken by the regional authorities.
He told Radiožurnál that he was halting the campaign for Christmas and would restart it in the New Year.
He specified that the campaign would fight corruption as such.
Jančura started the campaign after the regions decided to operate regional rail links with Czech Railways and had not announced tenders for the order, worth around 150 billion crowns.
According to Jančura this is illegal and in contravention of the principles of the European Court of Justice.
Jančura claims that his criticism of regional rail transport has already led to his being threatened by a member of the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we don't stop this, we could lose our bus licence.
He introduced himself as a member of the ČSSD, I know who it was but I'm not going to say his name, Jančura told Radiožurnál today.
Almost 200,000 children in Afghanistan missed out on a recent polio immunisation drive because of violence linked to the Taleban, the UN says.
The UN carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces last week.
But it says it could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
A UN spokesman said this was despite pledges from the Taleban that they would not attack or obstruct thousands of staff carrying out the vaccinations.
Gaspar Llamazares, the general coordinator of IU and member of the party Izquierda Unida, confirmed today that the decision for the case concerning the councillor for Youth and Sport of the city of Siviglia, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after the accusation of cronyism. The case will be up to the regional federation for training.
"I'm very federalist when considering this kind of issues, and the Andalusian organization needs to assume its responsibilities," said Llamazares regarding the resolution the party should adopt with the man who was an alderman in Siviglian board until now.
Moreover, the leader stressed the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations regarding whatever irregularity Silva had committed, "The UI always wanted these kind of investigations to have the maximum transparency."
Similarly, he stressed that training goes under "very strict codes of ethics for all public functions."
The entity was created to prevent the fall on the margins of the society of untrained young men.
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the social support entity Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have been helped to overcome a difficult situation during this century quarter.
To this there are added over a hundred jobs currently created ​​for this social group.
The anniversary served to make a balance at a ceremony held in the old factory complex Fabra i Coats where attended over 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the neighborhood of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little education, no job, and drug problems or at risk of falling into marginality.
The yesterday celebration at Sant Andreu gathered a large number of responsible entities and institutions that in these 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The diverse political representation, in the election time, showed the unitary character of the work done by Trinijove.
Next to the president of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, attended the ceremony the ex counselor of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall, and the ex lieutenant of the mayor and current eco socialist Councilman Ricard Goma.
Also attended at the Fabra i Coats the actual Counselor for Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries and CEO of the social work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
He said Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current period is also difficult, but added that the work done so far "is a good base."
The president gave Trinijove as an example for fighting against the bad circumstances and giving hope to people with difficulties.
"The crisis is not new to the entity and the work done by it," he said.
A proposed mosque in Temecula has won the unanimous support of the local planning commission following more than five hours of often heated public testimony.
Critics assailed the project as promoting both terrorism and traffic tie-ups.
But commissioners ruled Wednesday night the new religious center complied with local laws and would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people came to support it - Christians, Jews, Bahais, you name it," said Hadi Nael, chair of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, speaking Thursday morning.
"I'm proud of that as an American citizen."
"It shows that justice prevails."
"The opposition is very minimal," he added.
"They just have very loud voices."
"We have beautiful people in this valley."
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and lasted until nearly midnight with most of the time taken up with people speaking for or against the center, about evenly divided, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no more America," wrote one commenter.
"It is another Planet of the Apes with Miss Liberty dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
Planned Islamic centers also have sparked protests in other parts of the country, including near ground zero, the site of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New York City.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has denounced violence.
His congregation of about 135 families has co-existed without incident in Riverside County for years but wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse it rented on a property shared with a manufacturer of water-filtration systems.
The new 24,943-square-foot mosque with Mediterranean-style architecture would include two minarets and rise as tall as 43 feet.
It would occupy a 4.32-acre site on Nicolas Road about two miles east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal the project to the City Council.
Before facing the Blues on Tuesday evening   (  20.45 hrs  )   Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure, which this friendly match gave to them.
We do not go so far as to say that there was connivance between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the tribune of the auditorium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard made peace.
Five months following the gesture of humour of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian selector can only be praised.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to go forward, assures the Lillois.
In contrast between his respective club and selection performances, "it is of a piece if it is justified."
"At Lille, I am there all the year round, which is not the case of Belgium."
"I must take my marks."
Selected to play against Romania on Friday evening in its match against France, Hazard went to Saint-Denis in order at last to "shine."
Not however forgetting the notion of "pleasing."
He encouraged the Blues from the age of 7 years and the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I always supported them, he affirms.
This necessarily participates in strengthening even more the particular character of this match.
All the more so, since opposite are Mathieu   (  Debuchy  )  , Yohan   (  Cabaye  )   and Adil   (  Rami  )   ," he recalls.
"We just crossed each others path."
"To be able to play against them, that is pure happiness!"
With bonhomie, Leekens recalled "pride."
"Pride" of playing in "a gala match."
"Pride" also in inding ass "neighbour" that France has "become again a very high level team" only a little more than one year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc was a thunderbolt, he enthuses.
Now that Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician will share an aircraft with the Blues management... Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians become big," he stressed.
"One is building something, the players are ambitious, they are hungry."
"You will realise this during the matches to come. Including that against France.
The legendary defender Vjačeslav Fetisov will again play a professional ice-hockey match at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic winner and Stanley Cup holder will help out his team, CSKA Moscow, when they need him, and will evidently be playing in the fifth KHL duel against Saint Petersburg.
Fetisov, who retired at forty in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
Since Denis Kuljaš was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov is training regularly and has agreed to help the team.
We just need to sort out a few formalities, the AP agency quoted the Moscow club coach Sergej Němčinov as saying.
It's not year clear whether or not the famous hockey player's comeback will be for just one match.
I think Fetisov is someone who can boost the morale of the other players, said Němčinov.
According to AP, if Fetisov returns to the ice, he will be the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In the NHL, the legendary attacker Gordie Howe played for Hartford for a whole season at the age of fifty-one and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous quintet of Fetisov, Kasatonov, Makarov, Larionov, and Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players of all time.
In the Soviet Union uniform, he received two Olympic gold medals, seven world championship tiles, and triumphed in the Canada Cup and the Junior World Championship.
In the second half of his career, he also enjoyed success in the NHL, when wearing the Detroit uniform, he twice raised the Stanley Cup over his head.
Since 2001, he has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame.
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and did not manage to renew their old driver's licenses, the validity of which will expire at the end of the year.
Today is the last day for people to apply for the renewal so that the authorities could manage to issue the new license by the end of the year.
However, the ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers would set out on the road without a valid license after New Year's Eve.
According to the authorities, it is mostly those who do not want to drive anymore who did not renew the license.
While villages report a sharp decline in interest in driver's license renewal, the authorities in the city are overloaded with applications and the interest in the license renewal has grown this week.
The municipal council handles about 2000 clients a day.
They spend about half an hour waiting in line.
Roughly 140,000 drivers have not renewed their driver's license yet in Prague.
The issue of a new license takes twenty days.
However, it is possible to apply for the issue in the reduced time limit of five days.
In that case, the driver pays five hundred crowns extra.
Motorists who do not manage the renewal of the license before the end of the year and set on the road without a valid driver's license will be threatened with a fine.
A person who breaks the law will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
But the police can also settle the offense through a settlement.
In case of an administrative offense, the fine will climb to 2,500 crowns.
According to earlier information the council could even fine someone who does not drive at all.
Reportedly, such an individual could have paid up to 30,000 crowns.
The ministry earlier asked the authorities to be reasonable and issue a thousand-crown fine at the most.
However, according to Ministry of Transport speaker Karel Hanzelka, nobody will be threatened with ten-thousand-crown fines.
According to him, a driver's license is a document which the people should be allowed to decide whether they want or not.
It is not an identity card which everybody must keep validated.
Those who do not want to drive anymore should give the license up.
It is sufficient to take it to the competent municipal office or send it by registered post.
By the end of the year, the validity of the licenses issued during 1964-1993 will have expired.
However, motorists must also subsequently renew other types of driver's licenses.
People with driver's licenses from 1994-2000 have three more years for the renewal.
The validity of the licenses issued 2001-2004 will end in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this concerns roughly 2.6 million other documents.
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a rate faster than any other country."
The filtrations of Wikileaks confirm the bonds between the Taliban people and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the American embassy in Pakistan and the Department of State of the USA filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous restlessness which the Pakistani nuclear program brings about in Washington.
Besides the enlightening and substantial details that are offered on the content of the conversations and the thoughts of the credited North American diplomatic representatives in Islamabad, the documents reveal that the cooperation between both countries in the matter of atomic security, instead of increasing, "decreases," and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons with "a rhythm faster than any other country."
The peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program - that the arms are not assembled but they remain stored by components to make difficult their destruction in case of attack-- it constitutes one of the main causes for concern in Washington.
Thus is enumerated by the ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report previous to the visit of the ex- advisor of National Security, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear power plants on the territory under Taliban attack, the rumoured dispersion of the nuclear materials and the vulnerability of atomic materials transportation."
The high number of people implied in the nuclear arsenals and the missiles programs is being taken into consideration, not only by the USA, but also by Russia, such as the reason for maintaining its guard.
"Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs in order to protect the nuclear power plants; given the poor educative and cultural levels, the extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people to work in the nuclear programs or of missiles," said the expert Yuri Carole, from the Russian Ministry of External Affairs, in a meeting with his Americans homologous.
The newest information on the documentation filtered by the portal of Julian Assange is the decreasing cooperation between the USA and Pakistan in subjects of nuclear proliferation and the high Pakistani rate of nuclear weapon production.
An office of the embassy in May, that describes as "frustrating" the communication with Pakistan, says that: "The transparency is frequently nonexistent; the offers of aid remain without an answer or are refused."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, civil servant of the National Intelligence for the south of Asia, states that "in spite of the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons in a rhythm faster than any other country of the world."
The ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit of the head of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to give clear orders to the person in charge that "the Army of Pakistan must end the tacit support to the terrorist groups."
Some 19% of handicapped persons are looking for work.
The 15th week for the employment of the handicapped starts today.
Despite a public voluntary policy introduced in 2005, the rate of unemployment of the handicapped is still twice as high as the average, namely 19%, versus 9% for the population as a whole.
Discouraging?
"No, stresses Eric Blanchet, Director-General of Adapt, the association which organises the week for the employment of the handicapped."
"The progress achieved since 15 years ago is considerable."
"At that time the rate of unemployment was not 2x but 3x as high."
"There is however still a huge amount to do."
It must be said that for the handicapped, the obstacles to obtaining employment are still many.
They are rather old: 37% are over 50   (  17% on average  )  .
They have rather a low level of qualifications; 80% do not have the "bac" and out of the 2.3 million students in higher education only 10 000 are handicapped.
Lastly, long-term unemployment is very widespread, being 85% for the handicapped versus 38% on an average.
Briefly, all these are criteria which greatly complicate a return to employment and which constitute the nub of the problem," according to Christian Grapin, director-general of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies to recruit handicapped workers.
Here are some of the brakes.
It is hardly necessary to speak about mentalities, which do change, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the association IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité showed that the managers questioned had a low level of knowledge of handicap," with an "over-representation of persons in wheelchairs, psychically or intellectually deficient persons."
Result - private companies employing over 20 persons are still far from achieving the objective of employing the 6% of handicapped workers, fixed by a law dating back to 1987.
The latter known figures dating to 2008 have a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now on around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, director-general of the Agefiph, the organisation responsible for collecting contributions from companies which do not observe this law.
Proof: The number of "taxed" establishments, like the sums paid, have fallen between 2007 and 2011, from 59 000 to 46 000 structures   (  and from 606 to 480 million Euros  )  .
"The law of 2005, which raised the contributions, created a strong pressure on companies, explains Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also reflects a rise of consciousness, in particular within large groups."
According to the ministry of employment, only 59% of establishments employing between 20 and 49 handicapped persons, versus 82% of companies employing between 100 and 199 persons.
Applicants will have to go to the centres of Attendance for Visa Applicants before their interview in the Consular Section; the cost will be smaller and so will waiting times.
From the 10th of January of 2011 the procedure of issuing a visa in the Embassy of the United States and consulates will be altered.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants will have to go to the attendance centres for Visa Applicants   (  ASC, by its English abbreviations  )   prior to their interview in the Consular Section.
The ASC staff will take the biometric information of the applicant, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for the applicants, among which:.
The total cost of issuing the visa will be smaller; it will no longer be necessary to make a payment in order to get the appointment, another payment to process the visa request and another one so that the service of correspondence gives the document.
The applicant will make only one payment which will cover the three services.
The present tariff will remain unchanged: the equivalent of 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for cases of visas with request   (  including visas for temporary workers  )   and 390 dollars for visas of retailers and investors.
People who wish to renew their visa won't have to go to an interview with the Consular Official, but they will only have to go to the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and will have fingerprints taken.
Because the biometric information will be taken in the ASC, the applicants who require a second date for being interviewed in the Consular Section will attend one less time than previously.
Also,those requesting a visa in the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra tariff on service of 26 dollars.
For additional information on the new procedure for asking the visa, visit the following page http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.htm
Pakistani authorities on Saturday zeroed in on the alleged mastermind of a plot to send five Northern Virginia men to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, saying they hope the case could help unravel an extensive network of terrorist recruiters who scour the Internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were hunting for a shadowy insurgent figure known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after first discovering them when one made comments approving of terror attacks on the Internet video site YouTube.
Saifullah guided the men once they were in Pakistan, attempting to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt that is home to al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who had been briefed on the case said Saturday that Saifullah was unsuccessful in convincing al-Qaeda commanders that the men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were marooned for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the forbidding mountains of the northwest that have become a terrorist haven.
They were regarded as a sting operation.
That's why they were rejected, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case.
The official said the men were undeterred and were still trying to acquire the right endorsements to gain access to the al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement.
The case of the five -- who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI -- underscores the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps more importantly, determining who can be trusted.
Since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, U.S. intelligence has made it a top priority to try to place human assets inside al-Qaeda.
The organization's recruiters act as gatekeepers, keeping out those who are not serious about their commitment to holy war, and those who could be spies.
Would-be American recruits are treated by al-Qaeda with special scrutiny, analysts said.
But they are also considered enormously appealing to the group because of their potential to access U.S. targets and because of their propaganda value.
But Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst with the U.S.-based NEFA Foundation, said terror groups have also become much more cautious in recent years about who they allow in because U.S. intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruiting methods.
If you're trying to sink someone into these groups, what better way than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed? Kohlmann said.
The model is one that has become far more Web-based.
The Interior Office wants the driver under three administrative penalties for excessive alcoholic rate, to install in their car a system that prevents driving the vehicle when drunk. The same if you do not blow into the measuring device.
The measure was announced last June and has been already included in the Annual Report of the State Attorney General, according to which it will be a pilot project for a period of one year.
This project's goal is the reinstatement of the driver, since he will need to attend a course of road re-education.
The initiative is supported by the Attorney General for Road Safety, together with the General Directorate of Traffic  (  DGT  )   and the Technological Institute Foundation for Security in the Automobile  (  FITS  )  .
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of drivers fined more than once for drunk driving, still drive a car.
The 'alcolock' would avoid this, because the device, connected to the vehicle, measures the rate of alcohol in breath and prevents the driver from getting the car if he does not blow inside it, or in case it detects in the car an higher alcoholic concentration than permitted by law.
The cost of the device, a bit more than 1000 euro, should be charged to the sanctioned.
In this regard, a study conducted in 2007 in the United States proved that vehicles equipped with these devices can reduce the infringements up to 65% during the first year of introduction.
And in Spain it was estimated it could save around 115 lives in one year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: first of all to stop these behaviors before they turn into criminal offenses.
And second, to facilitate the implementation of this practice, as the legal reform can be ordinarily made, but, on the contrary, the necessary reform of the criminal procedure requires to go through an organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, even if it has already been introduced on an experimental basis in some trucks and public transports.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote a PSOE's initiative by which the party proposes to install the system in school buses, as has already been done in France.
The Iberdrola Chairman, Ignacio Sanchez Galan, was the first to speak yesterday before the subcommittee of the House of Representatives, where Spain's energy strategy for the next two decades is currently being debated.
After his speech, which was followed by the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galan gave the press a few glimpses of what was planned in the subcommittee behind closed doors.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and another 60 billion between that date and 2030, while they keep operating the nuclear power plants which are presently open.
Otherwise, the investments required will not be 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
Yes, Iberdrola believes that in the next decade investments should not be spent on increasing its generating capacity, but on distribution networks and on international interconnections.
From 2020 on, the matter changes and the power will have to increase.
His bet is in both coal plants withcarbon dioxide catchers and, especially, renewable sources of energy.
In this case, he considers that it takes 18,000 new MW, and that is with "support energy."
Though he believes that the Sustainable Economy Act, which the government has just approved, is in line with what his company has been calling for, Galan would not draw blood with a royal decree to promote the consumption of domestic coal, which contradicts the policies to combat climate change.
In his opinion, there is "a clear, long-term gamble" in this sense, despite the "sure" measures, as the Chairman of Iberdrola calls them.
As it is, Galan believes that the decisions to invest, even though they are long-term, should start to be made since it has already taken a long time to think them through, and a stable framework for addressing remuneration is necessary.
With one goal and simple measures, Hamburg SV conquers the top of the chart.
At Borussia, Luhukay remains unable to find a working team.
By Kristoffer Klein. Enlarge. Crash landing for German international Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player joined the game late and missed, lifting the ball to the crossbar.
His message was concisely phrased and left his throat convincingly.
He simply knew that he was right.
`We need the second goal,' Hermann Rieger hissed in the hallway at Hamburg Arena.
Not a lot was going on in the `catacombs.' The half-time break was over and most people had returned to their seats.
Rieger was HSV's physiotherapist for nearly three decades. He is held in higher esteem than some other lapsed actors.
And thus, his plea was heard by the powers that be.
Assistant Coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumb in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's Coach-in-Chief, Martin Jol.
The latter's order is likely to have been a similar one: Get me goal number two!
It was never executed.
`Not everything was fun to look at today,' Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt would also have `wished' for things to be `more relaxed.'
Hamburg has to thank Mladen Petric for scoring the 1-0   (  1-0  )   with his header   (  11th  )  ; and the fact that a very weak Gladbach team proved unable to hit the weak Hamburg team where it hurts.
`It was a dirty victory,' Martin Jol summed things up.
This Monday, Hamburg SV turns 121 years old.
Spectators began celebrating on Saturday evening - themselves, the blue sky above the Arena and the instant chart on the video screen that showed their club as top of the class.
It's going to be a birthday without a real party.
`We know where to file this one,' said Marcell Jansen.
He senses that the chart's intermediate report says more about the unpredictability of the Liga than about the dominance of his HSV.
The team and its belatedly signed-on new members - Brazilians Neves and Silva, goal-getter Petric, as well as Jansen, who was wooed away from FC Bayern - are slowly finding their form, but they are not shining brightly yet.
`We need more style and more dribbling,' Jol demanded.
Emotive campaign attacks drivers.
The most expensive action aimed at safety on the roads in Czech history.
That's also one way to characterize the emotive media campaign which the Ministry of Transportation plans to launch on Wednesday.
The office of minister Aleš Řebíček hopes that it will discourage drivers from behaving dangerously behind the wheel.
The 150-million-crown campaign will appear on television, on the radio, in cinemas, on the Internet, but also on flyers.
It should discourage drivers from speeding and driving under the influence of alcohol.
And also remind them to fasten their seatbelts before they start driving.
Above all, it aims to reach into the conscience of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians, and last but not least, professional drivers.
And what appears in the spots?
Mainly human stories that attack the emotions.
And even the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign attests to this:.
You don't think - you pay!
The words "you don't think" are written in capital letters on a license plate.
And then the words "you pay" are in a pool of blood.
This is meant to symbolize that a person can pay for a moment of carelessness with his/her own life.
The spots will "haunt" the viewers until 2010.
The ministry found inspiration in similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where it is common to find pictures with drastic images of accident victims.
It hopes that the accident rate and the number of deaths on the Czech roads will thus decrease.
The spots were prepared by the agency Euro RSCG.
Sugar and whip for drivers.
"The drivers are influenced by the sugar and whip system.
The sugar for them is, for example, when they run a red light, they save time.
The whip is the threat of a fine or an accident.
The drivers must be repeatedly reminded of the risk," says Martin Kořán, a transportation psychologist from Na Homolce Hospital.
And that's why information campaigns in the press and mainly negative advertising are necessary, the psychologist believes.
Less effective in his opinion are the tables which draw the drivers' attention to the danger.
"If a static table which warns against danger is installed, it will likely soon blend in with the surroundings and the drivers will not pay attention to it," Kořán warned.
To develop their latest and most precious gem, the Porsche engineers took the Boxster S as a base and succeeded in trimming it by no less than 80 kilos,making the total weight a mere 1,275 kilos.
This led them to, first, cutting out the automatic roof, which has been substituted by a manually-operated canvas one, saving 21 kilos; using aluminum doors, like those on the GT3, 'dropping' another 15, removing the climate control, 13; reducing the gas tank from 64 to 54 liters, earning 7 more kilos ; mounting sporty bucket seats, another 12, and with the 19-inch lightweight wheels, five.
Finally, foregoing the CDR-30 sound system brought it down another 6 kilograms, and changing the door handles to fabric ones cut the remaining kilo.
Even though it is also available with the PDK dual-clutch shift, the test was conducted on a unit with the six-speed manual transmission, mainly on the back roads of California and along stretches of really windy mountain roads.
Its performance can only be described as flawless.
The reduction in weight does not imply that the car doesn't grip the asphalt.
Rather the complete opposite: it has been some time since we tested a model so small and light, which, in turn, transmitted so much confidence when cornering, even at high speeds.
It is a small athlete, able to warm up its muscles in a low gear for as long as we need, until ordered to sprint, to brake, to recover and go back to exploiting its engine...
Just what we asked for. Thanks to its steering, as communicative as it is precise, what we tell it with our hands on the wheel is what the car will do.
And it will do it with surgical precision.
Optional engine noise.
The sound of its V6 boxer with 320 horse power   (  10 more than the Boxster S  )   is well made and can be enhancedwith the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the roar of the engine, which debuted earlier in the Panamera.
The acceleration is brutal, either from a standstill or recovering.
The suspension is firm but not harsh or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the highways we crossed with the Boxster Spyder was fairly beaten up, but the car handled the potholes well.
The electronic aids hardly showed up on the course; that is because, well into the morning, we found early morning ice and gravel on some curves.
In short, it is an ultra lightweight car, one of the most fun to drive on the market, andis a bit more than just a simple modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010, priced at 70,931 euros.
In Venezuela, times are about to change.
President Hugo Chávez has decreed that time-pieces in the South American country be turned back by half an hour on December 9.
In Spain, meanwhile, Chávez is becoming a figure of ridicule.
According to the Official Gazette of Venezuela, a new law decrees that clocks be set to GMT minus four and a half hours.
Thereby, the South American state creates its own time zone that does not apply to any other country in the world.
Chávez, whose disposition towards the US has been hostile, cited a number of reasons for his decision. Notably, he alleged that the worlds division into time zones according to full clock hours was an imposition by the United States.
On Wednesday   (  local time  )  , Chávez also announced a severance of diplomatic ties with neighboring country Colombia due to a hostage crisis.
As long as conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, the left-wing nationalist said, he would not entertain relations with Colombias head of state, nor with its government.
My dignity does not permit it, said Chávez. He is pushing for a constitutional reform on which citizens of the petroleum-exporting country get to vote in a referendum on Sunday.
The reform would provide a significant extension of his domestic power.
The dispute was caused by Uribes decision to revoke Chávezs mandate to negotiate the release of hostages with Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribes decision was a slap in the face for Venezuela, Chávez had complained on Sunday.
Chávez is the talk of the town in Spain, as well.
A new ringtone for cell phones is causing a furor in the country: Por qué no te callas   (  Why dont you shut your mouth  )  , says the line that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the internet.
It was spoken by King Juan Carlos of Spain. Annoyed by the left-wing populists incessant interjections, Juan Carlos had rebuked him at the most recent Ibero-American Summit.
Peek is extremely limited, a device that's only used for checking email, without no feature for viewing certain kinds of attachments or surfing the web.
It enjoyed its 5 minutes of fame in the U.S. when Times Magazine named it one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is more difficult, to be honest, but the idea can be interesting, especially for children.
Unlike smartphones, the Peek is very cheap and has a very low monthly fee, less than half, for example, of the iPhone's data plan.
Given its success, the company has released two new devices: one exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free data service for life in exchange for paying six times more for the Peek.
FonPeek, presented at the La Web event yesterday, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It is just as limited as its U.S. counterpart, but comes with a surprise.
The monthly service price, around 12 euros a month, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it's like to have to give up data when they cross the border or desperately search for a cafe with WiFi    (   or a Fon connection   )   to check their mail.
The idea of fixed-price roaming is incredibly attractive and long awaited.
Yes, some operators have special arrangements and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a doctorate in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the fine print.
The repeated twisting of the European Commission's arm to get affordable roaming rates across Europe has had almost no noticeable effect.
There's a fear of using data outside one's home country, and rightly so.
For a gadget like the FonPeek    (   it no longer seems strange that it is called Fon since it lacks WiFi   )    to get this kind of fee, it means that the operators are starting the think differently and study different means of recouping the cost of their data networks.
The Kindle is another good example, including a book downloading feature and other internet queries.
No contracts, no bother.
It's a connected device and is paid for when it's purchased, not month by month.
And that is what I hope to see one day with FonPeek, a call option with life-time access, which the Peek already has in the U.S.
Not because I'm going to buy it.
I check my mail on my phone, thank you.
I hope so because I think it's an unfair model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
After the start of a disquieting week for Italy, the situation yesterday was somewhat easier with the reflux of 10-year obligatory rates.
Return to precarious calm.
On leaving a meeting with the Minister of the Economy, the regional presidents said that Giulio Tremonti described the situation as "insoluble" and that he was waiting for an unforeseeable weekend, which he subsequently denied.
In any event on Tuesday the difference between German long-term rates reached a record of 210 base points and the price of contracts to cover the risk of bankruptcy   (  CDS  )   took off to reach 263 points, producing a certain amount of panic in Rome.
At a session of the council of ministers, Silvio Berlusconi pointed out that in Spain the differential from German rates was over 400 base points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, declared himself very worried by market turbulence and by a possible contagion from Ireland.
The good news is that Italy, the third largest economy of the Eurozone, is not like Greece and Ireland.
According to Irwin Stezer, an econoist at the Hudson Institute,the bad news is that it is like Portugal.
Clearly, its problem is an absence of growth and inadequate tax revenues, placing the State in in danger of no longer being able to cover its financial requirements.
The most recent forecasts from Brussels acted like a cold shower on the government.
Italian growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, whist the budget now under scrutiny by the Senate records 1.3 and 2.0% respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates that the public deficit will be 4.3% of the GDP next year   (  versus 3.9% forecast by the government  )   and 3.5% in 2012   (  instead of the forecast of 2.7%  )  .
This is the reason for the rumour of a new collective budget of 7 thousand million Euros, which might be drawn up after the holidays.
The economic affairs commissioner Olli Rehn said that if necessary, new austerity measures will have to be taken.
For the moment, Italy receives support from international institutions.
Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator of the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy at the IMF assures that the foundations of Italian economy are sound.
Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of OCDE, states that there is no problem in the immediate future, in the short or in the long term, because despite its large debt   (  119.2% of GIP in 2011, NDLR  )  . stabilisation efforts demanded from Italy are smaller than those demanded from other countries.
There remains the question of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, following which an early general election could take place at the end of March.
A period not suited to the taking of decisions in the event of a serious crisis would then begin.
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to masterminding twin attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a "resistance" fighter during his first public court appearance in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and Knights Templar Norway," he said before a courtroom packed with 500 people.
"I object to the court because you received your mandate from organizations that support hate ideology and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I acknowledge the acts but I do not plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for him to express his views."
For the same reason he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a pre-written speech with him, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to hold Breivik in custody for 12 more weeks, banned him from accessing media for four weeks, and said that authorities will have tight control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
Around 30 survivors and victims" relatives attended the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eye, others to confirm that he is being held under lock and key.
All attended with the goal of moving toward closure.
"I thought he seemed cold and inhuman," one Utoya survivor told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me I moved on a little bit after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the hearing and looked journalists and survivors in the eye as he entered and exited the building.
Despite Breivik's bizarre notion of being part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he is not insane, and said that there is no evidence he acted with accomplices.
It may comfort some that the July 22 attacks seem to be the work of one extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But that doesn't automatically ease the grief and confusion that an entire nation still feels.
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't," a relative of one victim said.
"It would be so much easier if he did."
Luisa Maria Calderon alleges that drug traffickers helped opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the governor's race.
President Felipe Calderon's sister appears to have lost her bid for governor of Michoacan during violent state elections, and she alleged Monday that drug traffickers helped tip the race in favor of one of her opponents.
Preliminary results gave the lead in the race for governor of the western state to Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The intervention by organized crime during the entire election process and especially yesterday is alarming, not just for Michoacan but for the entire country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview a day after Sunday's vote.
"They threatened our candidates, our poll workers.... They seized ballot boxes, set up roadblocks ... and ordered people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until losing the presidency in 2000.
But it is staging a comeback, and victory in Michoacan is an important step in that effort.
The PRI is hoping to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo appears to have only narrowly edged out Calderon, who had led polls before election day.
Calderon, a candidate for her brother's conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate for the leftist Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which currently holds the governorship, came in third, a bad defeat for the divided and hapless left ahead of the 2012 presidential vote.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the state capital of Morelia, denied ties to drug traffickers and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is President Calderon's home state, and he chose Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
Yet violence has persisted.
A PAN mayor was assassinated a week before the election as he campaigned for Luisa Maria Calderon, and numerous candidates quit local races out of fear.
For the PRI, though, however nasty the Michoacan election looks, a win will help the party's momentum.
The man expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said, "I think this victory should be very encouraging, looking ahead to next year."
Households will have to pay more since January, not only for all types of energy, but also for water and sewerage, heating supplies, and rents will rise in certain areas.
Families will have to pull out monthly hundreds more from purses from January.
The price of electricity will be raised up by 4.6 percent; gas will be about 2 percent more expensive, in some towns you will have to pay extra for water by up to a tenth and supply of central heating will often be more expensive.
Electricity price increase should cost houshould s in the flats hundreds of crowns a year more than now.
Prices of power energy were reduced by all the major suppliers at the same time; a significant increase in support for the production of energy from renewable sources, especially photovoltaics, is to blame then.
Although gas will only be slightly more expensive, it will happen when most people are heating their flats and thus have the highest consumption.
Annually they must then also take extra costs in account.
While electricity and gas will be more expensive across the country, central heating price change varies from place to place.
Price increase is planned mainly in larger municipalities.
For example, households in Pardubice and Hradec Kralove will pay since January for central heating about CZK 50 per month extra, families in Liberec will pay extra CZK 1,000 a year.
Residents of Prague may have more expensive water and sewer by more than 9 percent, in the event that the city increases the rent of the infrastructure.
If the rent does not change, Prague residents will pay extra 6.8 percent.
Price in Prague, however, will still be in a nationwide comparison rather low.
In the North Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, the water rate should increase by about 7.4 percent.
For example, the price of rent in 450 thousands of rental apartments, where regulation ends in January, may significantly increase.
For example, CPI Byty, which in Usti nad Labem owns about 2,500 apartments, plans to raise the rent from January by up to one hundred percent.
The company intends to bring to the court those who will not accept the new rents.
Regulated rents paid by people in approximately 300 thousand apartments could increase by up to ten percent next year.
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green party head Jürgen Trittin calls defence minister Guttenberg a liar for providing false information on the Kunduz affair.
SPD and Left Party demanding a clarification from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - After the recent revelations regarding the air raid of Kunduz, the opposition has accused defence minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg   (  CSU  )   of deliberate deception.
The minister apparently made "knowingly false statements" regarding the fatal bombing of two tank trailers in September, said Green party head Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD news programme Tagesschau.
This is generally referred to as lying.
The order to kill was given in defiance of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force   (  ISAF  )   for Afghanistan.
That is the substance of the report, which NATO had, which Mr. Guttenberg has read, said Trittin.
On Friday it was revealed that the attack was not only about destroying the abducted tankers, but also to specifically kill two Taleban leaders.
The US air strike ordered by the German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein, up to 142 people were killed of injured, according to the NATO inquiry report.
The Greens, SPD and Left Party Linke called on Chancellor Angela Merkel   (  CDU  )   on Saturday to address parliament immediately and to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the event.
Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the federal government's Afghanistan policy, and whether the Chancellor's Office, German army and intelligence service have approved this new strategy, demanded Jürgen Trittin and his Greens colleague Renate Künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm rejected the criticism resolutely.
The Chancellor's Office did not take any influence on specific missions of the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts over the presentation by the ministry of the background of the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert emerged.
According to information available to SPIEGEL, the two provided Guttenberg with correct and complete information on the background of the tanker trailer attack.
Officially, it was said that they had lied about the existence of the NATO reports and kept sensitive details from the minister.
From the entourage of the top official, however, it was said that the defence ministry had even been directed to several reports, including a two-page documents of the commanding colonel Klein and a report from the military police.
In the meantime, Wichert is supposed to have asked for clarification in a letter, reports the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung.
He has not received a response, it is claimed.
The ministry did not comment on the accusations on Saturday and referred to the fact that this would be clarified by the inquiry committee of parliament, which would be set up next Wednesday.
Since Angelina Jolie began working on her as yet anonymous directing debut in the summer, there has been trouble.
She wrote the script herself - a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
No one really knows much more than that - but that alone is enough to cause unease.
The rumour stubbornly persists that the woman - a Muslim - falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslavian war.
Bosnian women's organisations have protested immediately, in response to which several days of shooting planned in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary at short notice.
Since then, the film has been shot in Hungary and is in post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasečić from the Association of Women Victims of War wrote to Jolie via the UN refugee agency UNHCR and demanded a meeting with the actress, reported a Bosnian newspaper - Jolie herself is an ambassador for the UN agency.
However, she can hardly be described as diplomatic - Jolie offered to meet the women weeks ago in Hungary, but they declined.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, insists Hasečić.
According to Hasečić, there were no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie's behaviour towards victims told her enough about the script.
According to the UN refugee organisation, her organisation has recommended dismissing Jolie as an ambassador, reports the Guardian.
But what kind of script exactly has Jolie written?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture that read her script issued a permit for shooting in Sarajevo after some to-ing and fro-ing - it is not entirely clear why Jolie then did not go to Bosnia.
They fledgling writer herself asserts that she has no political motives in her film, has read up on the Yugoslavian conflict assiduously and wants to show the horrific consequences of war and give a voice to all sides involved.
In terms of content, however, she remained vague.
A second, considerably different synopsis of the film is being circulated on the internet. The lovers had known each other before the outbreak of war and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is kidnapped to a Serbian camp where he is working as a guard.
That sounds a very different story to the "rape victim falls for torturer" scenario.
The fact that Jolie's film actually begins before the war is clear.
According to Jolie, the pressure on her is "unfair and based on false information."
Now only the hackers from Hollywood can give her any peace by illegally posting the script on the web, as has been the fate of so many other scripts.
Young people and other opponents demonstrated Sunday evening on the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject in advance the outcome of legislation.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening at the closing of polling stations in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent elections.
While no results have as yet been announced, many young people came to demonstrate against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resignation."
Some confess to not having even voted: "What for, since they will do whatever they want of my voice," said a youth.
They do not believe that the regime which has made a good impression with foreign observers in order to resume discussions with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn.
The sanctions, which include visa bans for 40 Belarusian officials and the freezing of assets, could be lifted if the elections are seen as appropriate by the observers.
They have not been according to the opposition.
"We were kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the count," lamented Yuri Potemkin, the spokesperson for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties.
"It's a cosmetic change, emphasizes Alexander Milinkevich, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential and leader of the pro-European movement, because it's who counts the votes that is important, and here, that is the executive power.
If opposition members enter parliament, it is because they have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament could mean space on television, meetings in the regions, and proposed laws."
The opposition should therefore enter the political game because "we must open a dialogue with the European Union.
Because if our economy which is heavily in debt with Russia, enters into a crisis, and if we do not reform ourselves, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent".
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitored the electoral process, does not recognize the validity of the ballot.
She stressed that the participation figures seem too high, and that the spread in voter turnout   (  26% of voters in Minsk  )   has opened the vote to all sorts of manipulations.
"Have you noticed that there was an election, have you? Queries the Social Democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, one of two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was nobody at the voting offices.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition members in parliament, those who are most convenient to those in power."
The silence of the night falls on October Square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Committee welcomed their success.
Euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
With self-discipline of the winner Farmet has already overcome bad times.
Prize for the first place in last year's Vodafone competition Company of the Year was in the Slav House collected by the owner of Farmet Company, Karel Žďárský.
The jury then appreciated the efforts by which a small tool workshop in Ceska Skalice grew into a business with hundred-million turnovers.
"I can say that the award encouraged not only me but all my colleagues and increased our confidence for battles with the competition," says the last-year winner today.
In the early history of the Farmet company there was a desire to do something useful.
And so, when the state offered the father of Charles Žďárského to rent a small workshop to compensate for the communists-confiscated property, he did not hesitate any long, rejected a career in the company, where he was working, and with a few friends around his father he founded the company producing plastic tubs.
Soon after that they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
After eighteen years, they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
Greater awareness among the general public was won after the success in the competition through the media.
"Not only our customers have begun to perceive the brand Farmet much better, but also foreign partners have begun to appreciate that they work with a company that has achieved greater success in its home country," says Karel Žďárský.
Last year, however, was not only full of the euphoria of victories in FARMET.
Awards were based on firm economic performance until 2008 and only partly from 2009.
And just 2009 was the toughest year for the sale of engineering goods.
Crisis was at its very peak, not touching so many people yet, but companies had stopped their investment projects and began to restrict purchases of new machinery and technology.
"The situation obviously did not spare us."
"Sales fell by 40 percent, we had to restrict production and even discharge employees," explains Karel Žďárský.
A viable company must be able to take even such unpopular measures sometimes.
However, they managed and retained the profit, even though lower than before the crisis.
However, what FARMET would not compromise, is the investment in research and development.
"With the help of subsidies we have built a research and training center, we have enhanced our presentation at international fairs, won major awards in local exhibitions," says Žďárský.
The crisis seems to be behind them.
Revenues are growing again and so is the number of new employees.
"I wish the nice feeling of victory to the new winner, but in a more peaceful atmosphere," says Karel Žďárský.
Yesterday, the Nueva Rumasa holding company sifted through the details of the bid on shares which led to the acquisition of a stake of between 25% and 29.9% in Sos.
It is a percentage which doesn't require them to launch a takeover bid   (  OPA  )   for all of the securities.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa is offering 1.5025 eurosper share, to be distributed over 10 years, and with a 1% annual interest rate.
Sos shares closed yesterday at 1.85 euros; so, Nueva Rumasa's offer undervalued the company 18% below the market value.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real value of Sos.
The offer is subject to the decision of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jerezano group is giving a period of 15 days for shareholders to express their interest in selling securities.
The CNMV assured that it had not been informed of the offer, despite Ruiz Mateos' company saying that it had contacted a regulator.
If this comes to fruition, the payout would reach 611.7 million when the capitalization of Sos is at 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos is restructuring its management.
In an attempt to stay out of possible takeover bids and the legal vagaries of its former managers, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar, it announced the election of Maria Luisa Jordana as the director of the internal audit.
It is a decision which makes her the first woman to hold a senior position in the food company.
This is a newly created position which reports directly to the president of the group.
And not without controversy, as the company is still immersed in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of over 230 million from Sos to the Salazar brothers' holding company.
In fact, it's possible that Sos will reveal further diversions of funds in the next few months.
In regards to the Salazars' credit, the former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and Angel Fernandez Noriega   (  representatives of CCM and Unicaja  )   testified and affirmed that they approved of the diversion of 212 million without knowing where the money was going.
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy is going to make a trip to Brittany.
Facing the display of force by the fishermen who on Monday had badly disturbed the access to several ports in Brittany and Normandy, on Tuesday morning at Guilvinec port, in Finistère, the president of the Republic has decided to yield and to meet their representatives.
The latter have promised to accept "with a constructive spirit" and they hope he "will arrive with practical proposals".
A presidential visit which occurs at the same time as the general meeting of the "crisis committee" created by fishermen in Brittany to come up with measures of addressing the soaring prices of oil, which peaked at an average of more than 1.14 Euro per litre.
According to the Elysée spokesman David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be devised to help their enterprise to recover competitiveness and secure employment conditions and sailors' remuneration".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected with determination by the fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted slow driving operations in the Morbihan and Calvados, causing traffic jams for almost 10 km.
The leisure craft harbour of Quiberon was also blocked, but the roads to Belle-Isle were not blocked.
A filtering roadblock was set up on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors have already shown their determination on Monday by burning, since dawn, tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots at the port of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement has spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and on the Channel, such as Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where trawlers remained docked at the quayside or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked any movement of any merchant ships.
Fishermen in La Turballe and Croisic, in Loire-Atlantique, in the evening stopped the blockade of the important Total refinery at Donges.
Those at Boulogne-sur-Mer have decided to wait until after the meeting at the ministry on Wednesday to decide on possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" has to decide on Tuesday whether to comply with the movement and its participation in the planned meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the officials of the National Committee of Fisheries, which did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not give up" and "do not want to have to move onto Paris", for example, announced Liliane Cariou, president of the Fisheries Committee of Lorient.
Professional fishermen, who pay no taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but believe that the threshold of profitability for a vessel is achieved with diesel fuel prices less than 0.30 Euro per litre .
The story of Libya's liberation, or rebellion, already has its defeated.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried at an unknown place in the desert. Without him, the war is over.
It is time to define the winners.
As a rule, Islamists win in the country; the question is whether they are the moderate or the radical ones.
The transitional cabinet declared itself a follower of the customary Sharia law, of which we have already heard.
Libya will become a crime free country, as the punishment for stealing is having one's hand amputated.
Women can forget about emancipation; potential religious renegades will be executed; etc.
Instead of a dictator, a society consisting of competing tribes will be united by Koran.
Libya will be in an order we cannot imagine and surely would not ask for.
However, our lifestyle is neither unique nor the best one and would not, most probably, be suitable for, for example, the people of Libya.
In fact, it is a wonder that the Islamic fighters accepted help from the nonbelievers.
Their only excuse is that from their point of view, NATO raids were not controlled by an American general, but Allah, the greatness of whom they celebrated with each strike.
When winners are sought for in Libya, the West is not on the list.
We participated in a shooting, served Islam, and our politicians got rid of a dictator, their political ally, without any guarantee of profit.
Given the recent bad experience from Afghanistan and Iraq, we decided against military occupation of Libya.
The locals thus do not have to worry about expelling of the "crusaders."
Without the occupation, will the oil companies get Libya's black gold for next to nothing, though?
It is quite likely that they will not. The West will then finally be able to boast about its selfless protection of human rights.
Unless the followers of the Sharia law put a stop to that.
A new case of positive testing during the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, of the team Gerolsteiner, third in classification and winner of the best grimpeur shirt.
Reporting the news is the daily newspaper L'Equipe.
The 26 year old Kohl is the fourth cyclist tested positive to Cera, the third generation EPO, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli, and the German Stefan Schumacher, also from the Gerolsteiner team.
The analysis of the blood samples from Kohl form part of those performed within the last few weeks by the laboratories of Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-analysis confirm the tests as positive to Cera, the Austrian will lose the third place at the Tour and faces the two-year canonical disqualification.
Confirming the news of Kohl testing positive to the third generation Epo is the French anti-doping agency's chief, Pierre Bordry who informed the Associated Press that he had notified the Austrian authorities of the positive test results.
The 26 year old Austrian had placed himself on the finalist podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, also winning the polka-dotted shirt of the best grimpeur.
There will be no new drilling off the coast of the US Federal State of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico in the coming year.
The government in Washington has published a prohibition to that effect - thereby definitively scrapping earlier plans.
New drilling is also forbidden off the Atlantic coast for the immediate future.
Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar made the announcement on Wednesday.
The explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform in April was the trigger for the strict prohibition, which is to remain in force for at least the next five years.
Before the disaster that cost eleven workers their lives and led to the USA's biggest environmental disaster, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and industry, had signalled his readiness to allow new drilling in the eastern area of the Gulf of Mexico.
Advocators had hoped this would reduce the USA's dependency on foreign oil supplies.
Who will bear responsibility for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf has still not been conclusively decided.
The British energy company BP is the focus of criticism, and is faced with claims for billions of dollars.
A board of inquiry set up by President Obama is set to submit its findings at some point in December.
In October, Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar had revoked the prohibition on drilling imposed after the explosion.
In response, various oil companies immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out any further catastrophe with tougher controls and stricter safety regulations.
The responsible control authority, which fell into disrepute after numerous accusations of corruption, is being extensively reformed.
At the same time, the President has announced that lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas companies will be stopped.
The industry is warning publicly that the output in the Gulf will be significantly lower than in the past if regulation is tougher.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industry," is the outcome of a recent industry survey by the consultancy firm BDO - even before the prohibition on drilling was put in place on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also complains of the uncertainty faced by the industry. "No one knows what exactly will change in terms of regulation."
The organisation believes investment in new projects will be suspended indefinitely - at the expense of growth.
The first day of the congress of the Christian Democratic Union   (  CDU  )   on Monday 14 November, in Leipzig took place without any real problems arising for the Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is also President of the Christian Democratic party.
The future of Europe was not initially planned to be on the programme, but imposed itself in the autumn, in particular to satisfy the militants who will be watching the government's policy on Greece today and perhaps that on Italy tomorrow....
The motion on the preidency of the European Commission, tabled by the directorate, was adopted almost unanimously.
Out of 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained from voting.
The standing ovation lasting several minutes which they, Angela Merkel and then a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very Europhile Minister of Finance, received at the end of their respective speeches, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and of the motion, is embodied in the slogan "the right response to the crisis is not less Europe, but more Europe."
Not only because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the Euro."
For the Chancellor, "the time has arrived for a breakthrough in Europe ."
This could mean modifications of the Treaty of Lisbon, making it possible to strengthen the control by the European Union of the budgetary policies of the countries of the Eurozone, but this could also affect the election of the president of the European Commission by universal suffrage "in order to impart a face to Europe."
This is, generally speaking, the case of one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the congress, whose inspiration clearly comes from Wolfgang Schäuble.
Certainly, it is not probable that the Twenty-Seven will rapidly agree to this solution; Great Britain is opposed to it and the heads of CDU think that Nicolas Sarkozy is also opposed to it.
But the marker is in place.
Similarly, the delegates rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to weight the vote of each country-Member of the directorate of the European Central Bank according the size of its economy, which would clearly increase the weight of the German economy.
Anxious to calm the climate in her party, the Chancellor increased the number of her references to Konrad Adenauer and to Helmut Kohl, but she did not seek to influence the congress on the back of the "small" European countries, or of countries in difficulty, which are quick to criticise "arrogant" Germany.
Although the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "Franco-German friendship," Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except when in a hole.
Recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig was the scene of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
Can Islam Be French?
Pluralism and Pragmatism in a Secularist State.
AT A time when Swiss voters have called for a ban on the construction of minarets and there is widespread alarm over the supposed Islamisation of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, has written an informed and measured account of whether Muslims can integrate—and are integrating—into one of the continent’s most avowedly secular societies.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author’s last work, "Why the French Don’t Like Headscarves"   (  2006  )  , an elegant and closely argued study of an issue that divided and preoccupied the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr Bowen’s latest book has a broader and more ambitious canvas.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not just what the politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is actually happening on the ground.
He has spent months in the mosques, schools and institutes which now provide France’s 5m-6m Muslims with what Mr Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener, reproducing debates between teachers and students about the questions that concern them most.
Should a Muslim get married in a mosque or a town hall   (  or both  )  ?
Should young Muslims be taught about evolution and gay rights?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane issues, he argues, that are the stuff of daily life rather than the political dramas that preoccupy the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them household names, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, a Swiss-born Arab Muslim scholar and academic.
This new generation is trying to open up the debate about how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They are not having the argument all their way.
Conservatives are suspicious of the very idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists whom Mr Bowen interviews tend to be at odds with their Salafi counterparts—advocates of the purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia—who nowadays have a small but influential presence among Europe’s Muslims.
Mr Bowen thinks that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But accommodation requires give-and-take on both sides.
He questions how far French policymakers   (  and the intellectual elite that so fiercely guards laïcité  )   are really committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims are probably getting a rawer deal than the Catholics, Protestants and Jews who have also had to make their historic compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, he detects a "tightening of the value-screws".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one is inclined to say, "Yes, but not yet."
After spending more time in a Jets uniform the last eight-plus seasons than anyone, defensive end Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all.
Then he watched the second quarter unfold Sunday, when the Jets transformed a scoreless game into a blowout.
"Never seen anything quite like that," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had matched the gloomy clouds hanging overhead with sloppy play.
Then quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown strike, providing the perfect harbinger for an afternoon when their evolving connection took a giant leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns in the quarter, including one when a cornerback fell down and another with 10 seconds left in the half.
"I didn't go out of my way," Favre said of all the passes that went to Coles.
"He's a hell of a player.
Our communication has been great, regardless of what people may think."
While Favre and Coles played catch, the defense battered Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted an errant throw and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith tipped another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens forced a fumble by Warner.
The last turnover, the fumble forced by Bowens, might have been the most egregious.
The Cardinals had taken over on that possession with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard field goal for a 34-0 lead.
It was the most the Jets had ever scored in a quarter.
Asked to describe the craziness of it, Jets Coach Eric Mangini said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When he was told both - the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can tell you I enjoyed the second quarter a lot more than I did the third quarter.
There were a lot of points scored in a short amount of time."
Today, early in the morning, the Civil Guard has detained the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana   (  Popular Party  )   for his alleged conection with the city-planning corruption plot uncovered this week.
Also arrested was a secretary of the consortium and the head of the Municipal Police.
Jose Martinez Andreo, who last May was replaced by Juan Morales, current popular deputy, and then alderman of the municipality, and according to investigation sources consulted by the Chain SER, could be leader of this plot.
Agents continue registering the municipal dependants and the Urban Council and more arrests are not ruled out in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer Juan Morales has been named as the main suspect of the city-planning corruption plot uncovered in the beginning of this week.
As reported yesterday the Chain SER, the lawyer of the Popular deputy Juan Morales, thus witnessed, was arrested leaving the Morales address with important documents related to the plot.
More, the object of the investigation, according to sources of the investigation, is the presumed fees charged by Morales in exchange for facilitating the company/signature of a city-planning agreement with a Galician construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight people detained.
Is the subprime mortgage crisis infecting America's credit-card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is only natural that dorsal fins swirl around excitedly.
Now that America's housing market is ailing, predators have their sights on the country's credit-card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs reckon that credit-card losses could reach $99 billion if contagion spreads from subprime mortgages to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of strain are clearly visible.
There are rises in both the charge-off and delinquency rates, which measure the share of balances that are uncollectable or more than 30 days late respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it had taken a $1.4 billion charge in its American consumer-finance business, partly because of weakness among card borrowers.
It is too early to panic, though.
Charge-offs and delinquencies are still low.
According to Moody's, a rating agency, the third-quarter delinquency rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
A change in America's personal-bankruptcy laws in 2005 led to an abrupt fall in bankruptcy filings, which in turn account for a big chunk of credit-card losses; the number of filings   (  and thus charge-off rates  )   would be rising again, whether or not overall conditions for borrowers were getting worse.
The industry also reports solid payment rates, which show how much of their debt consumers pay off each month.
And confidence in credit-card asset-backed securities is pretty firm despite paralysis in other corners of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that issuance volumes for 2007 will end up being 25% higher than last year.
Direct channels of infection between the subprime-mortgage crisis and the credit-card market certainly exist: consumers are likelier to load up on credit-card debt now that home-equity loans are drying up.
But card issuers look at cash flow rather than asset values, so falling house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in borrowers' creditworthiness.
They may even work to issuers' advantage.
The incentives for consumers to keep paying the mortgage decrease if properties are worth less than the value of the loan; card debt rises higher up the list of repayment priorities as a result.
Card issuers are also able to respond much more swiftly and flexibly to stormier conditions than mortgage lenders are, by changing interest rates or altering credit limits.
That should in theory reduce the risk of a rapid repricing of assets.
"We are not going to wake up one day and totally revalue the loans," says Gary Perlin, Capital One's chief financial officer.
If a sudden subprime-style meltdown in the credit-card market is improbable, the risks of a sustained downturn are much more real.
If lower house prices and a contraction in credit push America into recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a grimmer future.
Keep watching for those dorsal fins.
The management of the Hyundai car plant in Nošovice has agreed with the unions to cut all overtime.
It is because of all this forced overtime that the unions have declared a strike on Monday.
This was confirmed by the Hyundai spokesman, Petr Vaněk.
The management, however, wants to come to an agreement with the trade union leaders for one Saturday shift this year.
We can't give up on our production plan, it's essential, so we have proposed voluntary overtime on Saturday December 19th, involving two shifts, said Vaněk.
The website Sedmička.cz wrote that the firm had offered all employees who are to work the Saturday shift a bonus of 400 CZK.
This bonus will also be paid retrospectively to those who worked on Saturday November 28th.
According to Vaněk, the firm has decided to change how it motivates its employees to take the proposed overtime.
Either they'll claim the additional wage for the overtime or they can take time off in lieu on December 28th and extend their Christmas holiday by one day, said Vaněk.
Additionally, all employees working the Saturday shift will have their travel expenses and lunch paid for.
Considering that overtime was the most pressing and thorny question for the unions, as well as for the protesting employees who brought production to such a grinding halt last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon to immediately cancel all overtime for December, said Vaněk.
Until last week, virtually every day the car plant workers had been forced to do two hours' overtime on top of their normal eight-hour shifts.
After signing the agreement, the trade unions will call off the strike.
Further talks should be held between the car plant management and union leaders on Friday morning.
On Wednesday, the head of the unions, Petr Kuchař, said that if they came to an agreement on the demands and sign the document, they are willing to call off the strike.
The situation at the plant deteriorated sharply last Wednesday when some 400 workers held a spontaneous strike to protest against the incessant overtime.
They were also protesting against bad pay conditions and alleged persecution.
The management responded by saying that employees had to work overtime to meet the demand for cars.
In Monday's announcement of the strike, the unions also asked that no sanctions be imposed against the workers who halted production last Wednesday.
The trade unions are asking the firm to keep overtime to a minimum.
Moreover, this year they are requesting that a 5000 crown bonus be paid for this work.
The Hyundai car plant in Nošovice now employs 2000 people.
The firm began series production last November.
By this September, it had made around 80,000 cars, and its current capacity is 200,000 vehicles a year.
The Nobel Prize for Economy goes to the American Paul Krugman for his studies on market models and on the localisation of economic activities.
55 year old Krugman is a neo-Keynesian that teaches at Princeton University and he is a well-known leader writer of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the major critics of the choices made in economy and foreign policy made by the Bush administration.
A few months after the attacks of September 2001, in the days when Enron was going bankrupt, Krugman had forecasted in an editorial published on the New York Times that the second incident would have been more determining than the first, in terms of its consequences on the history of the United States.
A prediction that started a fair number of disputes and that for years had been thrown in the economist's face, but has now been revealed to have been exact.
«I am surprised and also a bit annoyed by the speed with which recollections of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom have disappeared from public attention», declared Krugman towards the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an"economist of great value», but also an orator with a"very aggressive style, particularly critical of the excesses in liberalism of the Bush administration».
The Frenchman, Frédérick Bousquet, triple medal-holder in the long course 2009 World Championship, pulled off an international title for a distance he particularly favours, the 50m freestyle, at the Euro-2009 short course event in Istanbul on Thursday.
The first day of this competition, where full-length swimsuits are permitted for the last time, has seen only three world records beaten, whereas a wave of them was expected.
One record was improved on by the Hungarian, Evelyn Verraszto, 200m medly, and the two others by Russia in the 4x50m medly relay.
A regret for Bousquet, who had his sight set on the 50m freestyle world record, for which he holds the long course title   (  20.94  )  .
In one of the two high-profile swimming events, the 50m freestyle, it was the 28-year-old Frenchman who made his mark with a time of 20.53 in a final, where ten swimmers started instead of the usual eight - a first at the international level.
Bousquet bested the Croat, Duje Draganja   (  20.70  )   and the Russian, Sergey Fesikov   (  20.84  )  , but he did not manage to reduce the world record time   (  20.30  )   as he had envisaged.
One can always dream of better, and I had actually stated that, if the world record was in my reach, I would certainly attempt it.
Like Bousquet, the vast majority of swimmers were in polyurethane swimsuits, which will not be permitted starting the 1st of January.
Having unleashed 238 world records since February 2008, these swimsuits will end their epic story in Istanbul, which had also seen the first ones in 1999, during the same competition.
The use of these swimsuits did not assist the German, Rome's long course two-time world champion this summer, Paul Biedermann, on this occasion, where world records were at stake.
The young swimmer did not succeed in reducing the record he currently holds in the 400m freestyle   (  3:32.77  )  , but did, nevertheless, make an impression by achieving his second personal best time   (  3:34.55  )  , ahead of the Russian, Nikita Lobintsev   (  3:35.75  )   and the Dane, Mads Glaesner   (  3:36.82  )  .
I did not give it my all in this race.
I knew that I could not achieve a world record, but I managed to defend my title and have accomplished my mission.
Lobintsev will be a strong rival in the future, explained Biedermann.
The state government did not decide in parliament whether it would appeal against the verdict of Hesse's Administrative Court   (  VGH  )   to ban night flights.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to review the 400+-page VGH verdict, said economics minister Dieter Posch   (  FDP  )  .
The VGH in Kassel recently confirmed in writing that the state would have to reorganise the ban on night flights in the event of building the planned northwest runway at Frankfurt Airport.
According to the verdict, the granting of 17 flights between 11 pm and 5 am, as planned by the state government, is not compatible with the protection of the population from flight noise as specified by law.
The coalition must decide by 4 January whether it will appeal the verdict.
The opposition criticised this delay and called upon the government representatives to do without an appeal before the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD party leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel demanded the CDU and FDP to return to their promises to ban night flights, which they made before the election. Otherwise, this would have to be rated as the "breaking of a promise".
It is bloody difficult when you are allowed to keep one's word, said Greens leader Tarek Al-Wazir, alluding to the FDP election slogan "We keep our word".
Minister Posch rejected the accusation from Schäfer-Gümbel that the state government was trying to achieve their night flights by "skewing justice and playing tricks".
A detailed legal examination would take time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of "a brief first impression".
We need a legally compliant decision, said Stefan Müller   (  FDP  )  .
As presented by the opposition, his party never made any statements regarding the ban on night flights.
The real estate market in Bulgaria has been developing at an unbelievable rate - all of Europe has its eyes on this heretofore rarely heard-of Balkan nation.
Who is buying what and where on this market, which is still the cheapest in the EU despite rapidly rising prices?
This analysis comes from RE/MAX's Bulgarian division.
No question but that Bulgaria is the most sought-after East European real estate target, with its low-cost ski chalets and oceanfront homes.
The most fashionable mountain sites are Bansko, Borovets, Pamporovo and Vitosha, while on the seaside the areas to which people are flocking are Albena, the Golden Sands, the Sunny Beach, and ancient Sozopol and Nesebar, although a rising number of investors are looking into real estate around Karvarna and Balcsik, too.
According to RE/MAX Bulgaria analysts, sooner or later, the central portion of the country will begin attracting investors. So a growing number of people are already buying properties in Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Tryavna -, and more and more investors are looking around the Rousse area, which is expressly cheap at the moment.
Sofia, the capital, also has many attractive opportunities. Commercial and office space offers the highest returns.
Bulgaria is well on the way to becoming one of Europe's most exciting golf paradises. This means it need not only be a priority destination in winter and summer, for it has the resources to attract visitors during the other two seasons, too.
Forward-thinking investors are already making major purchases, for instance, in and around Bansko.
Analysts suggest that people who buy real estate in Bulgaria would also like to change their lifestyles.
Most investors are from Britain, but many also come from France, Belgium, and Spain, with a growing number coming from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors have also gained a foothold, while Russians are traditional big-time buyers at the Black Sea and along top ski slopes.
There are three types of international buyers, said regional manager of RE/MAX Bulgaria Georgi Yankov.
The ones who plan to resettle in Bulgaria either purchase renovated properties for prices ranging from 50,000 euros to 100,000, or old fixer-uppers for 5,000-15,000 and then renovate them themselves.
They want their purchases to be easy to access, and to be equipped for modern communication. It is important that they be in a big city, with shopping and, generally, a local doctor nearby.
The next group of buyers is interested in summer homes   (  Bulgaria joined Germany's list of top-ten holiday destinations in December  )  .
The third includes investors for business purposes, who are counting on medium or long-term appreciation.
Real estate prices in Sofia, the capital, are rising steadily, as is demand.
While Bulgaria boasts the European Union's lowest real estate prices, they have still gone up by 21 percent in the past five years.
Actually, the rise in real estate prices has exceeded the growth in salaries.
The actress Heather Locklear, Amanda of the popular series Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara   (  California  )   after driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness viewed her performing inappropriate maneuvers while trying to take her car out from a parking in Montecito, as revealed to People magazine by a spokesman for the Californian Highway Police.
The witness stated that around 4.30pm Ms. Locklear "crushed the accelerator very thoroughly, making excessive noise and trying to take the car out from the parking with abrupt back and forth maneuvers. By reversing, she passed several times in front of his sunglasses."
Shortly after, the witness, who, in a first time, apparently had not recognized the actress, saw Ms. Locklear stopping in a nearby street and leaving the vehicle.
It was this person to alert the emergency services, because "he was concerned about Ms. Locklear's life."
When the patrol arrived, the police found the actress sitting inside her car, which was partially blocking the road.
"She seemed confused," and for this reason the policemen led her to a specialized centre for drugs and alcohol and submitted her a test.
According to a spokesman for the police, the actress has proven collaborative and the hypothesis of excessive alcohol was discarded since the very first moment, even if "as the officers observed at first sight, we believe Ms. Locklear was under the effect of any drug."
Ms. Locklear was arrested under suspicion of driving under the influence of some - not better specified substance, and imprisoned in the local jail at 7.00pm, to be released some hours later.
Two months ago, Ms. Locklear was out of a specialist clinic in Arizona where she was cured after an episode of anxiety and depression.
The lawyer for the aggrieved families, Igor Veleba, is requesting 12 million Czech crowns in compensation for the switch of the babies in a maternity clinic in the Třebíč hospital, plus legal expenses.
Three million for each of the mothers, two for each father and a million for each child.
The hospital is offering a maximum of 200,000 for each of the parents.
The hospital's attorney, Ondřej Dostál, therefore radically disapproves of Veleba's proposition.
"We reject such a claim, it is too high," Dostál said after today's meeting.
"To be able to define our position to the counter-motion, we need the expert opinion the opposing side has had made.
We will find out if it has any informative value at all.
Still, we stick to our opinion that it is going to be in hundreds of thousands for all," Dostál stressed.
According to him, the sum should range from 100,000 to 200,000 for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Jabloňov family demanded a million crowns for each month they were not with their biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert opinion which the Motol University Hospital in Prague had elaborated for him as a basis for the negotiations.
According to the advisors in the field of psychology and psychiatry, the parents of the children have suffered psychological injury and stress of various degrees and intensity.
The stressful situation was better endured by the men, though they struggled with remorse that they did not prevent the switch of the newborn babies.
On the other hand, the women are coping worse with the urgency of the trauma experienced and of what is happening right now, Veleba summed up.
Veronika and Nikola were switched by the nurses in the Třebíč maternity clinic on December 9 of the last year.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks to Přibyslavice and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloňov.
Vysočina county supervisor Miloš Vystrčil gave 100,000 CZK to each of the families as compensation for the expenditures that ensued from the mistake by the Třebíč hospital, run by the county.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured for the liability for damages by law.
In case of error, they have to dig into the reserve fund, and in exceptional cases they can seek help from the founder.
By now the courts have awarded relatively low compensation to people, with the sums calculated according to the tables in six digit numbers, exceptionally in seven digit numbers, in Czech crowns.
This estimate takes into consideration the unwanted pregnancies   (  24 %  )   as well as the unplanned births.
Nowadays, more than one pregnancy out of three   (  36 %  )   is still unplanned, reveals a survey conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies   (  Ined  )  , forty years after the Neuwirth law, which legailized the contraception in France, was voted.
This estimate takes into consideration the unwanted pregnancies   (  24 %  )   as well as the unplanned births.
Different contraceptives, such as the pill or the coil, have a failure rate which is still between 5% and 6%, estimated the Ined.
In spite of that, the legalization of the contraception leaded to a better «fertility control», expliques the Institute according to which the rate of the pill's use among women between 20 and 44 years old has nowadays risen to 60 %, against 5 % in 1970.
Finally, nowadays eight births out of ten would be well planned.
One couple out of five would even plan the birth's month, choosing when possible the springtime, considered the best period for having a child.
Strange lights of unknown origin have been seen over Norway.
Yesterday the Russian defence ministry finally admitted that it had tested an intercontinental ballistic missile not far from the Norwegian border.
However, it was another unsuccessful launch and the missile, which is known as "Bulava" and should have been the pride and glory of the Russian army, has gradually turned into a nightmare for the Russian generals and Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence at tests on the rocket has not affected the success rate of the test flights.
The Bulava has generally not lifted off or has been damaged in the air.
The Russian newspapers are describing the "Bulava" as "the flightless rocket."
The rocket that doesn't fly but lights up.
This, the 13th test, started off according to plan.
But near the end of the flight there was technical damage to the missile.
Apparently the engine blew up in the rocket's third phase.
This time, the "Bulava" was launched from the atomic submarine Dmitrij Donskij, which was cruising under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of rocket can be launched from a craft which is moving and even submerged.
This makes it likely that the mysterious light over Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the malfunctioning "Bulava."
Anyway, the Norwegians never had any doubts that it was a Russian rocket.
The generals are defending themselves this time though, claiming that it can't be described as a total failure.
The first two phases of the rocket went well, and the accident happened during the third stage.
Previously, the engines have always malfunctioned during the first phase.
Even though not one test launch has been completely error-free, the defence ministry consider only six out of the thirteen tests to have been failures.
The generals are optimistic about this almost fifty-percent success rate and keep insisting that the "Bulava" will eventually fly smoothly and will even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks weighing a total of 1.15 tons.
The remaining two of four show dogs stolen from outside a Bellflower motel have been found, Los Angeles County Sheriff's officials said Thursday.
The four show dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh corgis - vanished Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van they had spent the night in outside a Bellflower Motel 6, authorities said.
Two of the canines were recovered Wednesday afternoon, and the remaining two were found late Wednesday evening, said to Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is that the dogs are fine," said Whitmore.
"They are in good condition."
"They have been returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore declined to say precisely where the dogs were found, in what neighborhood, and the circumstances surrounding their discovery.
"There is an investigation going on."
"We don't want to say," Whitmore said.
"We are following leads."
The dogs owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be reached for comment Thursday.
They were reunited with their two Akitas at a county-run animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's deputies found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were unharmed, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis Rickard and Peek planned to show at area competitions this week on behalf of the dogs' Japanese owners, remained missing until their discovering late Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town for the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach this weekend, where they planned to show Trace.
The other dogs were expected to compete in other competitions scheduled in the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one stop on the couple's nearly month-long tour of dog shows.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van right outside their room window.
They brought three other dogs - a Boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany - which stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the thick-furred Akitas and corgis in the van where it would be cooler.
They opened the windows a bit, so the dogs could get fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the van stolen at 6 a.m. Tuesday.
Peek had said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the corgis, which are implanted with microchips to identify them.
It was unclear Thursday whether an award would be given.
Czech Republic, like most of Europe, woke up covered in snow on Thursday morning.
The roads and pavements are mostly covered with compacted snow, in many places road maintenance stuff drove all night.
D5 between the 89th and 93rd kilometer in the direction of Rozvadov has been closed in the morning due to several accidents of trucks and passenger cars and D1 is also blocked in the direction from Brno to Prague.
News were informed by the central dispatcher of Automotoklub   (  UAMK  )  .
At the 91st kilometer truck crashed, at the 93rd kilometer two trucks collided, the accident included injury.
Also several cars ended up in a ditch.
Problems are also on the D1 highway at the 185th kilometer in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks have collided there.
Drivers should leave the highway just after Brno at the 190th kilometer or go through Brno and drive back to the highway at the 182nd kilometer at Kývalka.
There are car queues several kilometers long.
Also, there is an accident at D11, at the very arrival in Prague.
There is a layer of snow, several centimeters thick, in Prague, the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
There are queues of cars in Prosek, Štěrboholská is also blocked.
The most reliable means of transport is the subway.
Trams run delayed between Charles Square and Namesti Miru.
At eight in the morning Prague emergency staff should meet once again.
Also railways and airports must are facing the problems.
Czech Railways have had to cancel seven fast train connections due to snow.
There are problems with the railway line from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroun.
Passengers should check the current situation.
Ruzyne airport was closed from 11 pm Wednesday night to 5 a.m..
Most of the roads in southern Moravia are now passable, but only with caution.
There are three impassable side roads in the Vyškov area, there is loads of snow in the Brno area and snow chains are necessary for travelling on certain communications in higher parts of Blansko region.
The most affected sites included the Vyskov area.
There are closed roads still: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
For their extension routers will be deployed.
It is impossible to estimate when they will be passable again.
In the Hodonin area, caution is necessary when travelling in the White Carpathians.
On roads that are there in order to protect the environment just kept passable with inert fill, there is a 5-centimeter layer of snow, said ČTK.
In the Czech Republic from two to ten centimeters of snow has fallen, most in northern Bohemia, often up to 18 centimeters.
In the Moravia-Silesian Region about 15 centimeters of snow has occurred.
Snowfall in the Czech Republic gradually ceases.
Support systems to emergency brakes will have to be a mandatory feature in European cars, just as it happened with anti-lock breaks   (  ABS  )   and will happen with stability control   (  ESP  )  .
In fact, they are already in all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while the rest have a grace period until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase pedestrian safety; however, how they work can also help prevent many rear-end collisions.
What the emergency brake assistant does is increase the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency, which the system detects through the driver's pressure on the pedal.
But this doesn't always maintain that pressure through to the end.
According to a study conducted by the car components manufacturer, Bosch, a third of drivers involved in an accident had not stepped on the brake before a collision and half of them didn't apply the full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents.
The intervention of the aid, however, calls for the full braking system, reducing the distance the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with this feature, 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided a year.
The reduction will be even bigger -it estimates that one in four accidents injuring people would be avoided - when the so-called smart emergency braking systems become popular.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system which   (  via radar or a camera  )   detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to lightly applying the brakes.
If the driver reacts, he helps it by increasing the pressure on the pedal if it is necessary.
If he does not react, and even though the collision is unavoidable, the device exerts the maximum force to the brakes to minimize damage.
At present, EADS shares are definitely in decline in Paris Stock Exchange, since the aeronautic and defence company has announced its willing to spend an amount between 1,2 and 1,4 milliards euros for facing the A400M's delay.
EADS is losing 4%   (  at 21.96 euros  )   in Paris Stock Exchange.
The group had to re-examine its forecasts for the 2007 operative result since the delay caused by the slow developement progression of the A400M engine, which affects the inauguration flight of the plane.
The cost for overcoming the delay in the delivery of this aircraft, announced in October, is "around 1,2 and 1,4 milliards euros, of which more than 1 milliard goes for the Airbus", announced EADS, the European global leader in aerospace.
Because of these charges, EADS will have to annouce new EBIT targets for 2007, on the occasion of next Thursday's presentation of its quarterly results, added without any further information about prices.
Moreover, the group states that the estimation of the new charges is consistent with the six-months delay.
It should be reminded that EADS operative result fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to the charges associated with the delay of another programme, the one of A380 shareholder.
At the beginning, the group expected to deliver the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The leading European newspapers were describing the ever-deepening international financial crisis as "a second September 11th" in their Tuesday comments.
The global financial catastrophe is due to the American president - says the Rome-based La Repubblica blamingly - the president was not even able to have his own party back up the hastily prepared bill which is supposed to find the way out of the depressing situation...
It is not so much a new Pearl Harbor, as Warren Buffett billionaire investor described it, but rather a second September 11th.
Some of the Madrid press also blame Washington for the situation.
In the view of El Mundo, the collapse of the world economy is due to the lack of political leadership in the U.S.
The American financial system is at a growing risk of collapse, which will make the whole world suffer.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, now - pursuant to the congressional vote - the threatening risk is if Washington does not provide any political tool to handle the crisis.
World economy is hanging in the air - just at the time when one of the biggest transformation of capitalism is taking place.
"The threat cannot be ignored any more", marks the Tages-Anzeiger from Geneva.
Some countries are still able to provide a life-belt for the weakened financial institutions and can save those from bankruptcy by the money of the taxpayers.
However, if further banks collapse, as in a domino-effect, neither the funds nor new improvisations will help.
What we need in the long term is that the members of the European Union shall determine themselves to overcome their own national selfishness and centralize the control over the divided financial markets.
"The aid distributed just on Monday among the ailing financial institutes was more than 100 billion euros", recalls the Vienna-based Der Standard, adding that the worries are getting to point out that, just like the Americans, the European taxpayers will also have to dig down into their pockets in order to remedy the situation.
The EU has not paid special attention to the crisis so far, which is now sweeping through the old continent as a tsunami.
It is not expected from the "savers" to wave 100 billion euros in their hands right at the beginning but it would be important to determine the situations when the taxpayers' money is necessary to be used in order to prevent a more serious damage.
Facebook users can know the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new application Trovit, the search engine with the largest number of real-estate, employment and car classifieds in Spain.
The tool "How much should you charge?" estimates wages of users from more than 140,000 employment offers in Spain on Trovit, based on a form available on Facebook, where you must enter your profession, years of experience, your age and the city where you want to work.
In the week that the application was launched, the search engine had detected that in general, the Spanish worker "feels underpaid," said the Trovit Product Manager, Albert Ribera.
According to the data Trovit uses from its search engines in the United Kingdom and France, the Spanish are the lowest paid.
A British programmer charges 45,226 euros gross per year, and a French one 31,059, as opposed to the 24,000 a Spaniard receives.
Similarly, a driver receives an annual net pay of 34,247 euros in England, 25,751 in France, and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest paid job in Spain is waiter, with annual net earnings of 11,592 euros; followed by salesperson, with 14,725 euros, and operator, with 15,667 euros.
The most searched-for jobs on the net in the past three months are drivers, part-time jobs and social worker.
